Led a team of five using an Agile software development approach to create a program that retrieves and visualizes environmental and health data for selected countries from the World Bank's data repository.

Working in sprints, we delivered the specification, design, implementation, and testing of the system. Our design process included creating UML diagrams with design patterns such as Singleton, Strategy, Factory, Proxy, and Observer. For implementation and testing, we used Java and HTTP GET requests, ensuring a robust and efficient solution.
