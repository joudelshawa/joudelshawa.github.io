Excessive laboratory testing contributes to significant healthcare costs and patient burden. This project develops a deep learning framework that predicts whether a glucose test will be ordered in the next AM/PM time bin, using the GEMINI dataset.

The model integrates **Clinical BioBERT embeddings** for unstructured notes with **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** networks for temporal modeling, achieving **ROC-AUC 0.92**, **PR-AUC 0.67**, and **cross-hospital generalization 0.84 ROC-AUC**. Temporal recency cues further enhanced predictive stability.

The project was **presented at the AAAI SecureAI4Health Symposium 2025** (poster + lightning talk) and showcased at **Vector Remarkable 2025**, marking progress toward real-time decision support for reducing unnecessary lab tests.
