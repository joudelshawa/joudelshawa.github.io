As part of the Women+ in Technology Society's Ada Mentorship Program, six first- and second-year female undergraduate students developed "Your Perfect Closet," a Chrome extension designed to enhance online shopping experiences. The project addressed the challenges faced by users who struggle with the overwhelming number of choices and the difficulty in visualizing how clothes will look together when shopping online. The extension allows users to save items from websites like H&M into a single, interactive drag-and-drop interface, where they can mix and match outfits on a personalized avatar. This streamlined process reduces the hassle of multiple open tabs and improves confidence in online purchases.

The project used tools like Figma for wireframing and JavaScript for the Chrome extension. As a mentor, I guided the team through the Agile process, helped them with technical challenges, and inspired them to pursue careers in technology.

This project won two awards: Most Creative Project and Best JAM3 Project (for building a product that helps a company leverage technology to improve their customer experience).
