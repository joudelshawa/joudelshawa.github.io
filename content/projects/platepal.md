The Plate Pal project aims to address food insecurity by developing a user-friendly website that helps individuals with limited access to affordable groceries.

Plate Pal is designed to generate a curated list of the most budget-friendly grocery options based on the user's postal code and specific dietary restrictions. The platform creates a seamless and empowering experience, enabling users to make informed decisions about their food choices.

Key features include:
- Compiling a comprehensive list of weekly offers from nearby grocery stores.
- Optimizing users' purchasing power.
- Providing a stress-free, personalized grocery plan.

Goals:
- Improve the affordability of food.
- Address food insecurity.
- Promote healthier eating habits through tailored recommendations based on location, dietary needs, and budget constraints.

As a mentor, I guided the project team in achieving these objectives, ensuring the development of a practical and impactful solution for food insecurity, as well as ensuring their pitch was engaging and informative.
