Unstructured clinical text poses major challenges for automation and interpretability in healthcare. **Hermes** is a **multi-agent large language model (LLM) framework** that sequentially converts discharge summaries into structured **SOAP-format reports** and **knowledge graphs**.

The system integrates four specialized agents — Hermes-R (report generation), Hermes-G (graph construction), Hermes-Q (question-answer generation), and Hermes-A (answer validation) — that collaborate through **iterative refinement and semantic validation loops** to enhance factual accuracy and consistency.

**Accepted and presented at the AAAI SecureAI4Health 2025 Symposium** (poster + lightning talk), Hermes demonstrates how coordinated LLM agents can improve the reliability and interpretability of clinical natural language processing.
